      <h1>Hologram</h1>
      <h2>What is Hologram?</h2>
      <p>Hologram is a small ruby script, made by <a href="http://trulia.com">Trulia</a>, that takes an OOCSS project and generates
      a style guide for you based on comments found within the
      project. You can find an example project that uses hologram at
      github. It is similar to Kneath Style Sheets, and a little less
      similar but related to Styledocco. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal of hologram is to help you maintain a beautiful living
        documentation system along these lines:
        <a href="images/screenshot.png"><img style="width:650px;" src="images/screenshot.png"></a>
      </p>

      <h2>Why would I use it?</h2>
      <p>Hologram was written to make building a style guide as easy as
      maintaining you css. Documentation is written in your css files
      using a combination of YAML and Markdown. By using Markdown you
      can easily format your docs however you wish, and fall back to raw
      html for those tricky parts that every style guide has. 
      </p>
      <p>An important part of any style guide are code examples
      alongside the visual output. Hologram makes this easy by extending
      Markdown code blocks that can be marked as examples:

        <pre>
```html_example
&lt;h1&gt;This is an example that should be displayed on the page and
    as code&lt;/h1&gt;
```

```js_example
&lt;h1&gt;This is an example that should be displayed on the page and
    as code&lt;/h1&gt;
```
        </pre>
      </p>

      <h2>Where can I get it?</h2>
      <p>Hologram can be installed by using <code>gem install
      hologram</code>
      </p>

      <p>Additionally, Hologram is open source (licensed as XXX) and can
      be found on <a href="http://github.com/trulia/hologram">GitHub</a>.
