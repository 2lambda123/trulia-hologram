    <title>Hologram: Style Documentation Build System</title>

    <h1>What is Hologram?</h1>
    <p>Hologram is ruby script that takes a directory of css, sass
    and/or javascript files and creates a style guide for you from
    comments found inside your source files.</p>

    <h1>Why would I use it?</h1>
    <p>There are other style sheet documentation systems (such as Kneath
    Style Sheets and styledocco), but they have their own set of
    limitations or rules that make it difficult to get up and running.
    To use Hologram all you need to know is markdown, a little bit of
    yaml, and you can be off and running.</p>

    <h1>Where can I get it?</h1>
    <p>Hologram can be found on github, feel free to send pull requests
    or open issues as well.</p>
